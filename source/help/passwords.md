# Passwords in arXiv

arXiv uses two types of passwords:

-   User account passwords for accessing your user account page
    ([https://arxiv.org/user](https://arxiv.org/user))
-   Paper passwords for claiming ownership of an announced article submitted by
    co-authors or a proxy

## User account passwords:


-   Details about setting up your account are on our [registration help page.](../help/registerhelp.md)
-   If you forgot your user account password, please see the [lost
    password form](https://arxiv.org/user/lost_password).
-   If you need help recovering an arXiv user account, please [contact arXiv administrators](../help/contact.md) for support.

## Paper passwords:

arXiv maintains [authority records](../help/authority.md) for the works within our corpus.
These are the list of author accounts who are authorized to make changes (referred to as the **owner**).
When an article is first submitted to arXiv, the submitter is the only owner of that work. 
They receive the **paper password** as part of the announcement e-mail when the final 
arXiv-id is assigned. See [authority records](../help/authority.md) for more information regarding 
how co-authors may become an owner. 

If you have not received the paper password for your article after its announcement, 
please contact arXiv administration through the [user support portal](http://arxiv.org/support/general_help) to request the password.
