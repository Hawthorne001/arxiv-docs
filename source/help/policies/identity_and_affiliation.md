# Identity and Affiliation

## Policies

-   Claimed affiliation should be current in
    the conventional sense: e.g., physical presence, funding, e-mail
    address, etc. This information can be updated from [your user dashboard](https://arxiv.org/user/).
-   Each user may have only one registered arXiv account. If you are
    attempting to register a new account and are unsure if you already
    have an account please contact [arXiv user support](https://arxiv.org/support).
-   It is a violation of our policies to misrepresent your identity or
    organizational affiliation. Misrepresentation of identity or affiliation, for any
    reason, is possible grounds for immediate and permanent suspension.
-   Users must comply with arXiv's [Code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md).

## Managing your identity

arXiv recommends a consistent representation of your name to aid search and discovery of your works. 

Linking your ORCID to your arXiv account is recommended to connect your arXiv papers to your scholarly record.

### Has your name changed?

If you would like to request a name change, please contact us through our [user support portal](https://arxiv.org/support) or at help@arxiv.org.

Name changes can be made:

-  In full-text works: the author name can be changed in the PDF and/or LaTeX source where it appears in the author list, acknowledgments, and email address
-  In metadata: the name and email address can be changed in the author list metadata and in the submission history metadata for all existing versions
- In user accounts: the name, username, and email address can all be changed

We are not currently able to support name changes in references and citations of works. Also, arXiv cannot make changes to other services, including third-party search and discovery tools that may display author lists for papers on arXiv.
